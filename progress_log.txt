Set up the devlopment environment and added dependencies for ScalaFX and ScalaTest.
Created the initial project structure necessary for developing the game map.

Implemented the TerrainTile trait with a couple of example terrain tile classes
implementing it with different degrade methods based on their nature and
ConfigurationConstants, changing TerrainTiles' "projectile passability" property to
"elevation" to model the terrain itself more realistically and leave projectile
passability to be calculated by the game class based on the tile properties instead.
