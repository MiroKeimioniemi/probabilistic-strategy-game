Launch configuration

The launch configuration below represents the map and initial placements of units in the game. It may be modified so that each continuous word (_ or _,_) is separated by at
least one space character. The number of words in the first row gives the map width and the number of rows gives its height. Any incomplete rows will be padded with the top
left type of tile. Units on the left belong to Player 1 and units on the right belong to Player 2. Each row must have the same length and be of one of the following:

Grass
Forest
Rock
Sand
Dirt
VegeDirt
Gravel
Objective (conquering of which will gain points towards winning)


A Battle unit can be placed on top of a Terrain tile by writing a comma after the latter and then writing one of the following:

Soldiers
Sniper
Tank
